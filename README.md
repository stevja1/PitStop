# Pit Stop
CarMetrics, back from the dead!

## Backstory
Pit Stop is a project that I originally started in order to learn Java server-side technologies (Struts/Hibernate at the time) and Adobe AIR's runtime.

After determining that Adobe AIR was terribly slow, and Spring Boot was sooo much better, I decided to replatform the whole thing. I hope that this version is a little easier to maintain and use.

## What is this?
Pit Stop is an app that helps you keep track of your gas mileage. The goal is to help you determine if changes that are made to driving style, vehicle performance, etc improve or degrade fuel economy.

## Where does data get stored?
Data totally gets stored in the cloud. I have access to all of it. Unless you fork the code and implement your own cloud backend, which you can totally do.

## Why?
Why not?

## Why React Native? Don't you know that JavaScript is a scourge that must be stomped out?
So, up until about a week ago, I'd totally agree with you. I had an interesting conversation with a colleague of mine named Courtney who just switched from being a backend engineer to a frontend engineer. Courtney mentioned that React and React Native (and ES6) made JavaScript not suck so bad anymore. After spending a weekend with it, I have to agree. I'm actually kind of excited to mess with this, but I also understand that JavaScript is still considered the dark-side for some.

## Why Java and not Go?
Whoa... let's not get too cray cray.
